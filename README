# 🧠 Symbolic Multiplayer Game Experiment

This project is a minimalist multiplayer game prototype built using:

- 🐍 **Python** with [Ursina Engine](https://www.ursinaengine.org/) for 3D rendering
- 🟢 **Node.js** for lightweight server-side coordination
- 🌐 **HTTP-based communication** for player position syncing

Each player is represented by a colored cube in a shared 3D space. The server assigns unique IDs to each client, ensuring glitch-free multiplayer rendering.
